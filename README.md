## More Info
### Copper Anvils
 - Crafted with 4 copper ingots, and 3 matching copper blocks, for copper anvil (based on the copper blocks used). Unwaxed copper anvils can be waxed when shift clicked or crafted with a honeycomb item. <br>
 - Unwaxed copper anvils degrade / oxidize from usage like regular anvils. They also degrade at approximently the same speed as an isolated copper block. When degrading from fully oxidized it breaks dropping nothing. <br>
 - Waxed copper anvils do not work as regular anvils, instead being useful for decoration. <br>
 - All copper anvils are affected by gravity, and deal less falling damage than a regular anvil. <br>

### Gold Anvil
 - Crafted with 4 gold ingots and 3 gold blocks for one anvil. <br>
 - Gold anvils don't have damage stages, and vanish when a regular anvil would get damaged. <br>
 - Gold anvils deal more falling damage than a regular anvil, but less than pointed dripstone. <br>

### Netherite Anvil
 - Crafting by upgrading a gold anvil with a netherite ingot and upgrade template. <br>
 - Netherite anvils will never break. <br>
 - Netherite anvils deal as much falling damage as pointed dripstone. <br>
